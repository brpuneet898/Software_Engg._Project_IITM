we looked at various deployment environments and strategies and now in this video we will look at the infrastructure which is required to host or deploy these application right and this is known as hosting the application and now these web applications are usually hosted or deployed onto server systems right and clients they access the software service or the app from the server right and an important characteristic of such environments is that they should be available all the time right 24 hours a day throughout the year with no unplanned downtime right especially for production environments the web application will be used by actual users and which will hold real data right hence it is very important that these systems should be available at all times and user data should be stored secure so in this video we will look at different options by which we can host our application so what are these options so you can either use bare metal servers to host your application or use infrastructure as a service provider or platform as a service providers so let's look at each of these in detail now bare metal server is the in this option you actually purchase the server Hardware which is required for the application right and you purchase This Server Hardware you set up the operating system the web server and the web application right and this server system is similar to a normal desktop system right it has a CPU motherboard RAM and disk storage all of this of course at a very high configuration and there are other features which are specific to servers software and systems and unlike desktop computers they take different forms and they are more compact for example you have rack servers you have blade servers right they occupy lesser space such so that multiple servers can be arranged in a rack or a stack and now one advantage of using your own server is that this option gives the highest performance right so this server is available exclusively to you right it's not shared by other applications or by other users right you have exclusive access and hence that gives the highest performance however what is the disadvantage so one disadvantage is that this option is the most expensive upfront right because you have to pay you have to initially pay a lot to procure the server Hardware right usually servers cost around lacks of rupees and not only that the lot of time and effort is spent initially in setting it up right you have to set up the hardware the OS the server and the application and not only that time and effort is spent and money is also spent in maintaining it right let's say some part malfunctions or it has to be repaired right so you have to take care of ongoing maintenance as well another hosting option is to use an infrastructure as a service or an IAS provider right so what does the IIs provider do so the IIs provider provides a part of that infrastructure to you right so the IIs procures the server Hardware right it configures an operating system on that and it provides a part of this infrastructure to you for a particular fee right so for example let's say the is has a eight core processor which with 32 GB of RAM and what it does is it slices this into eight parts right and each of these parts are known as a virtual machine right and each VM contains One Core and 4 GB of memory right and for you as a developer who wants to host their application you have you have exclusive access to this VM with this one core and 4 GB of memory right and here you can set up your application right you can copy your relevant code set up the web server and the database and you need not worry about the underlying server Hardware maintaining it and so on and there are examples of is providers like digitalocean AWS and linode so what are the advantages so one advantage is as we saw it is cheaper right the cost the monthly or the yearly cost for is providers are significantly less than you know buying a server up front right and as we saw no maintenances required however it has its own disadvantages right so each is provider like digitalocean AWS they have their own set of configurations their OS the memory right and we have to work with that and be aware of that and see if it is suitable for our application and as we saw the infrastructure is shared by others right you do not have exclusive access to a single server right and hence the performance might not be better than let's say running your own exclusive server now another hosting option is the platform as a service provider right so what does the past do so in addition to the infrastructure it provides the software layer as well right on which the web application can be deployed so the pass automatically sets up the web server and database also for you right we have to provide some configuration options right like which web server to be deployed what is the database and all of that and the pass helps us to deploy the application with minimal effort right so examples of past providers are Heroku Google app engine right and now what is the advantage of using a pass so one is that it is very easy to deploy right so if we have the code available the pass will help us take care of most of the setting up of the web server and the database servers and other things whereas the disadvantage is that you do not have much control over your application right you will not know what is the underlying operating system what is the hardware how is it configured right and hence you will not have much control over the underlying aspects of the system foreign
