in the previous video we looked at different ways in which we can create a schedule for our project so another aspect of project management is to identify and mitigate risks which can occur in a project so what is a risk so a risk is an anticipated unfavorable event that can occur while a project is underway so it is anticipated because based on previous experiences or particular characteristics of this project we can anticipate that such a risk can happen and it is unfavorable because these are things which can derail the project or maybe even cause the delays and even stop development of the entire project and in the case of software the intangible nature of software also makes it difficult to identify risks right because it is difficult to control something which we cannot see so let's take the example of building a house so we have a contractor or a construction manager who overlooks the entire construction right and he or she can see how the construction of the house is taking shape so for example setting the foundation you add slabs you add the frame the roofing interiors painting so in all these activities these are visible to the manager right he can see how the construction is taking place and can assess the progress of the work as well as control however in the case of software it is not often the case right for example a simple syntax error can break an entire system and also third-party modules which we use they can have certain vulnerabilities or it might be outdated and this can also delay the project so another thing to note is that software is built by people working in a team right and conflicts or disputes within the team can also cause delays or disrupt software development now that we have seen what risks are and why it's important to identify and mitigate risks let's reflect on what are potential risks in a system like the amazon seller portal so what do you think are potential risks or categories of risk in the amazon seller portal you can pause this video and think of some potential risks before proceeding so many of you would have thought about risks related to the technical aspects of the project and these risks are known as technical risk and these kind of risks occur due to the development team's insufficient knowledge about the product and it can occur at any stage in the software development process in the requirement phase the design the implementation testing or even the maintenance phase so what are examples of technical risk so one is the team develops the wrong functions or the user interfaces and this can occur mainly due to in ambiguous or incomplete requirements which we get from clients so how can we mitigate this risk so we have seen this earlier also we need to communicate with clients or we build prototypes and get feedback from them so that we do not develop the wrong functionality or interface another example of a technical risk is shortcomings in the external components right so external components are components which are built by a third party vendor and these might be buggy it might not be up to the mark it might have certain vulnerabilities so how can we mitigate this risk by benchmarking by periodic and regular inspections to see that the module is up to the mark now the next category of risks are project risk so project risks occur due to problems in the budget the schedule and personal resources or even customer related problems so all type of risks which are non-technical can be categorized as project risk so the most common risk is scheduled slippage right the project falls behind schedule and how can you mitigate this risk one is you create detailed milestones so we saw in the previous video about project scheduling and we create detailed milestones in the schedule itself so that the entire team is aware of the different milestones and we constantly iterate and we communicate frequently with the clients even if we are falling behind schedule another example of a project risk is insufficient domain knowledge or technical knowledge by members in the team so for example in the amazon seller portal maybe members of the team they would not have worked in an e-commerce application before so how do we mitigate this risk mainly by hiring right hiring the right kind of people with relevant experience maybe within the company who are working in different projects or outside the company and we can also outsource important modules to experienced third party vendors as well another type of project risk is personnel shortfall right people might leave the project or organization in between and how can we mitigate this risk this risk can be mitigated by cross training right we train multiple people with skills which are required to work on the project so for example in the amazon seller portal maybe we make multiple people work on the payment gateway module right as it requires specialized knowledge so it's good if multiple people work on that project now another category of risks are known as business risk right and these risks are risks which can harm the business aspects of the software product so for example by the time the product is complete maybe it is not competitive in the market right there might be other products which are doing much better so the way to mitigate this risk is to explore the market for similar products address the gaps which are there in these products right another example of a business risk is gold plating right we develop unnecessary features so the development team feels that there are some features which are very good which are very nice to have even though the clients have not expressed the need of such a feature right and this is known as gold plating and how can we mitigate this risk again we communicate with the clients to see if they really require this feature and also do a cost benefit analysis right is the feature important is it worth it does it add value does it satisfy the users needs and based on this we make a decision so to summarize we looked at several types of risks and how to mitigate them we looked at technical risks which are risk related to the technical aspects of the project then there are project risks which occur due to the non-technical aspects like budget scheduling and other factors and business risks are risks which can harm the business aspects of the software product now another important aspect is to assess which risks have to be worked on right so the project manager along with other team members they come up with a set of risks for the project so how do they do that so they ask everyone in the team for the worst case scenario and based on this the project manager creates what is known as a risk table and for each risk the project manager he or she assigns a probability p from 0 to 100 and what is the potential impact of this risk so if this occurs you know is it a negligible risk is it marginal is critical or is it catastrophic which can derail the entire project so what is the impact of that particular risk right and then the risk is calculated for each of the identified risk by multiplying the probability with its impact right and then you sort the table in descending order and then you decide which risk do you actually want to work on so let's take the example of the seller portal right so maybe as a project manager i decide that you know schedule slippage and lack of experience building e-commerce applications these are you know serious risks and their impact is also high and even personal leaving although the probability i decide as a manager is slightly lesser i the impact is quite high whereas another risk of you know the database not being able to scale for large numbers the impact of that is less and maybe the project manager believes that the team has sufficient technical expertise to mitigate this risk right so based on uh so the project manager identifies these risks and then assigns a probability and an impact to each of them and then sorts this table in descending order and then the team or the manager decides which which risks to actually work on so you cannot work or anticipate all the risks which can happen in the project but you focus on the most important ones and then the project manager can decide to mitigate these risks by maybe creating milestones by conducting regular meetings with the team and clients and to mitigate the lack of experience the manager will make sure that they hire the right people outside and within the company so in this way we saw how we can identify assess which risks are important and mitigate these risks as well
