ER known as digitalocean right so digital ocean provides us with the infrastructure that is the hardware and the operating system to host our application so let's see how this works so you can sign up for a free account right or login right so I'll log in with my credentials and I will put my code right and once you log in you get you can create new projects right so I already have an existing project right so I have what is known as a droplet right so a droplet is digital oceans term for virtual machines right so this droplet right which is very Sim March 2020 this has a 1GB of memory it has 25 GB disk space right and it runs and it runs on Ubuntu 1804. right and you can there are several things which you can look at for example you can monitor the bandwidth the CPU usage the disk i o all of that right and this the very same web page right this is hosted in digitalocean right and what you can do is now let's say we want to create a new project so I can create a new project some description and some purpose right and if you want you can move existing resources like apps or droplets to this test project I'll skip for now right and the way we get started is by creating a droplet right so drop droplet is digital oceans term for a virtual machine right so I choose so first thing you have to choose a region so I will choose the Bangalore data center thing because it's closest to us right and you can choose which operating system you want right which version right and here is where you have to choose right the type of droplet which you want or the type of virtual machine that you want right so for simple applications write a basic droplet will do right it there are various CPU options if you want a regular one or if you want a premium Intel or AMD right and these are the costs for various configurations right and if you want to know details about which plan to choose you can click on this link right so one main difference is each droplet you can either choose a shared CPU or you can have a dedicated CPU right and there are yeah so there are different plans which are available right and it tells for basic droplets you know like for example blogs or discussion forums or you know small projects which you want to try out basic top droplet would do just fine right so based on your need right you can select right what type of infrastructure you want right for example the highest here is like it has like 256 GB Ram right and 4.69 TB data storage all right so and based on that your cost is calculated for per month right so the minimum cost here is around let's say six dollars a month right you can also add additional storage and you can also choose your authentication method like so if you want to connect using an SSH then you can connect to the droplet via your terminal right from your system or you can use a password right and you can enable monitoring then you can enable backups and yeah so there are various things which you can do right and once you do this once you create the droplet then you can log in to this droplet or this virtual machine using the credentials which you just provided here and then you can deploy your application right so you just like how you would Deploy on your local system right so you log in to this droplet right maybe check out the code from GitHub right set up the web server the database server and all of that on this droplet and run the application right so in this way is providers like digitalocean and AWS provide us a way to deploy our application on their infrastructure
