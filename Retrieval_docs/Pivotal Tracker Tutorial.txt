tool known as pivotal tracker so pivotal tracker encompasses several of the ideas regarding agile which we discussed this week so basically what pivotal tracker does is it tracks user stories and velocity so let's look at some of the functionalities of pivotal tracker so you can go to this URL pivotaltracker.com and you can sign up as a new user and after you sign up you will most likely get a tutorial video which I encourage all of you to watch and it gives up an overview of what all prevented tracker does so after you log in you have to give or you have to name your first project so let's say we name it as iits software engineered in Project right and when I click on create project you see several Windows several tabs right so the first thing which you see is known as a current iteration or the backlog so this is similar to the product backlog idea which we saw this week right so this describes user stories that you're currently working on or stories which are prioritized to work on in a particular in the current iteration right and icebox is just like a dumping place where you can add ideas or stories which haven't been prioritized yet right and here you can see that this is the length of the iteration so let's say I choose my iteration of Sprint to be two weeks and so it gives the dates 18 to 21st August and I can also add members to my team so for example right now I am the only one but you can invite people to join this project and they become part of the team so let's now try adding some user stories so let's take the example of the Amazon Seller portal itself and if you recall we had several user stories so let's say I add one story in which I add a catalog item right and the story type there are several story types but right now we are just focusing on features or new features which we want to add priority let's say it's of a high priority and you can assign points to it so let's say I assign two points to it which tells me that it's a medium sized user story it's not too difficult it's not too easy right I can add some description some labels so if I have links to a code to a branch in GitHub I can add that here and I can also add tasks to this user story so let's say if I want to add a catalog item if that is the main user story then maybe I can add a task saying create and review UI screen or maybe create the DB table for catalog right so these are just some example tasks right then I can add comments or yeah and I can also assign or create owners for this right so I click on Save right and so now I have created a user story and this is there in my current iteration right so similarly I can add another user story of say let's say if I want to add an inventory item and this is also a feature this is also let's say of high priority and this also requires say two points right so here then I can add several user stories now another important feature of Pi pivotal tracker is epics right so so what are epics so epics are you know a collection of related user stories we can group several user stories into what is known as an epic so for example catalog management right can be considered as an epic right because we have several user stories like adding a catalog item editing you know viewing all of them deleting a catalog item all of them all these users stories are part of this Broad idea known as Epic so then I can add some description and I can add a comment or something I'm leaving everything blank right so catalog management is an epic similarly Inventory management can be considered another epic right and so now that we have added documentary and a big a user story known as ADD inventory item now we can assign this to the catalog man sorry the inventory management Epic right and similarly for the add catalog item you can link it to the catalog management thank you mate and as we said ice box are ideas or stories that have not been prioritized yet so for example customer feedback can be an idea which we want to implement in the future let's say order tracking is another one right okay so now that we have some user stories and epics now uh we can and we can also determine the velocity for example in this iteration how many points can I complete and that is known as the velocity so let's say uh I choose my velocity to be 4. right and now I can assign these user stories to different users or different people in my team and right now I'm the only one so let's say I start working on this on the add catalog item user story so I click on start right and then I start working on it and then maybe I add some comments let's say I added the UI screen please review right maybe I can add an attachment a file upload or a link right so it gives me a trace of what all I have done right and let's say I have created the UI screen I've created the database table I've finished the tasks in this right then what I can do is I can say that it's finished and once I've finished a user story then I can click on deliver and what does this does is this sends a status update to the product owner and the product owner can look at this user story and look at the comments or look at the links provided can review it and choose to either accept or reject this user story so let's say I find certain shortcomings and or some bugs and I I as a product owner I reject it and I say let's say too many bugs many s cases are failing please fix right something like that so it now it goes back to the person who was do who was in charge of this user story right so then I can choose to restart it and continue doing that the same thing for the ad inventory item right I can for this user story I can similarly you know add multiple tasks post comments send or post links to the completed event to the completed user story and then I click on finish and then I click on deliver and now this goes to the product tool now the product owner can choose to accept it right and this shows that now in my current iteration or backlog this user story is completed and this is ongoing right and if you look at let's say done right so so this is this is an overview of what all can be done in this tool known as the pivotal tracker and there are other features like analytics for example now it shows project Trends right uh what is the rejection rate how many stories have been accepted what is the story cycle time right what are recent epics so these are different statistics which the product owner or members of the team can see and this is these are useful metrics which will help the team move forward and improve in subsequent iterations so this is a basic overview of this tool known as pivotal tracker and you can use this or similar Tools in your own software projects as well and this gives you a a clear picture of the entire software project what are the different user stories what is going on right now and it can help members of the team to sync up together and move the project forward
