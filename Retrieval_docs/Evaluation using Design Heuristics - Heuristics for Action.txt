we looked at Nielsen's design heuristics and looked at heuristics related to understanding in this video we look at heuristics related to action let's look at the freedom heuristic so there are different aspects of the freedom heuristic one is the freedom to undo so we saw this in the previous videos as well so let's say we have deleted a file we can always recover it from trash and document editing softwares have recovery options and keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl Z2 undo another aspect of freedom is the freedom to explore so platform should provide freedom for users to explore the key features so for example in shop online shopping portals we are able to look at products without actually signing in these platforms give us the freedom to explore the products another example is of the IRCTC website 10 years ago so here we can see that the earlier IRCTC website did not allow users to search for trains without logging in hence it restricted users freedom to use key features of the application whereas now we can search for tickets without logging in foreign next heuristic is flexibility so experts as well as new users should be able to carry out tasks efficiently so new users often require guidance when using a system and need clear and obvious options so they usually rely heavily on step-by-step results or clearly labeled menus however more experienced users learn the required keyboard shortcuts to complete the same tasks let's look at example of document processing softwares like word Google Docs Etc so when a new user needs to edit a document they will initially go through various menus and click on the card copy and paste menu item and as they gain fluency and experience using this word processor they will start using shortcuts another aspect of flexibility is providing personalization this refers to tailoring content and functionality for individual users for example social media apps they provide posts and content based on your interests or your history flexibility also involves customization whereby allowing users to make selections about how they want the product to work an example of this is news apps which asks users to select which topics they want news about the next design heuristic is recognition over recall so users have limited memory and they are not able to recall some information however they find it easier to recognize something they have seen earlier so for example if I ask you what is the capital of Spain you might not be able to recall but if I ask you is Madrid the capital of Spain then you might recognize that you have read about this information before the same is true for user interfaces as well for example in the pre-gui era how could we move a file from one location to another in Linux so we had to type in a command such as MV the file name and the destination folder so users had to remember the command the parameters Etc but now moving a file from one location to another is pretty straightforward you just have to right click on the file or use shortcuts and you know how to do it another important aspect is that the interface the buttons navigation all of this should help the users reach their final goal an example of this is Google's recent change of their icons so here if you look at the image on top where the previous Google product icons were the color form and shape could help us easily determine the functionality of each app so for example the postcard like letter shape of the Gmail app is immediately recognizable and points to the functionality of Gmail that is checking and writing email however after the redesign all the apps have the same color and form the idea might have been to give a consistent design across Google products but a lot of people complained that they were finding it difficult to distinguish between different apps on small screens such as mobile phone hence it is essential that the user interface and buttons do not add the load of making users remember something
