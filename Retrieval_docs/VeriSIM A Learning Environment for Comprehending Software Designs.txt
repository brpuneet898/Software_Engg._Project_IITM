we looked at the unified modeling language or the uml diagrams we saw that uml diagrams describe different views of the system in this video we will be looking at the very Sim learning environment very Sim stands for verifying designs by simulating scenarios using this learning environment you will be able to develop an integrated understanding of the class and the sequence diagrams so let us look at the software design context in very Sim so in very Sim you will be introduced to an automated door locking system you will be introduced to the requirements of the system for example One requirement can be that the user can register himself or herself by entering a passcode then the user can choose a lock or an unlock option so when a user chooses a lock option and enters the correct passcode the door should lock however if the passcode is incorrect the door should remain unlocked a similar requirement is there for the unlock option as well now these requirements are modeled using various uml diagrams such as the class diagram which is shown here on the left and one of the sequence diagrams for unlocking is shown not the right the automated door locking system has a class diagram and several sequence diagrams which model the requirements of the system so in very Sim you will be introduced to a strategy known as the design tracing strategy so consider a scenario of the automated door locking system so let's say that the door is initially locked and the user selects the unlock option and enters the correct passcode on doing this the door should unlock so what is design tracing in design tracing you construct a state diagram Which models a given scenario so in this case this state diagram models this given scenario we can see that the transitions in the state diagram correspond to parts of this scenario so we see initially that the user selects the unlock option and then they enter the correct passcode and finally it's the door unlocks so these transitions correspond to messages in the sequence diagram and based on these transitions we see that the states which contain data variables and their values these keep on changing so for example when the user selects the unlock option the value for the variable option selected changes to unlock these variables are taken from the class diagram and the transitions are messages which are taken from the sequence diagram so as you construct these diagrams this will help you model different scenarios in the system and thereby help you develop an integrated understanding of the class and the sequence diagrams so what are the activities and where is Sim you will be first introduced to what very Sim is what the learning objectives are then you will move on to the problem understanding stage where the requirements and the design diagrams for an automated door locking system will be given to you the next stage is the design tracing stage where you will attempt different challenges which will help you construct the state diagram which you saw in the previous slide and these challenges can be attempted in any order and finally you will go through the reflection stage which will help you reflect on what you have learned in very Sim after each of these activities there are evaluation as well as reflection activities which will help you reflect on what you have learned in that activity so this information is enough for you to now go and attempt very Sim happy learning
