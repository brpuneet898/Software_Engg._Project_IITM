in the previous video we looked at goals and principles to design usable interfaces so usable interfaces refer to interfaces that are effective efficient learnable memorable and safe and they also ensure that users have positive experiences while using these interfaces so keeping these goals and principles in mind we can now start building interfaces which implement the user stories and requirements and also recall that the process of interaction design it involves first identifying the needs and requirements then we develop alternative designs that meet those requirements then we build interactive versions of these designs and finally we evaluate the user interface so now let's say we have identified the needs and requirements and we know what the goals are which we need to keep in mind while building such systems so now we can proceed to the second step of developing alternative designs and building interactive versions of the user interface but how do we do this can we directly jump and write code do you think that is a good idea so let's reflect on this question are we ready to code once we know the needs and the requirements can we code the ui right away what are some reasons for not doing so you can pause this video and think of some reasons before proceeding okay so what are some reasons for why we shouldn't start coding right away one is that the initial design ideas it might not be the best ones so users may not like certain aspects of the initial ui second developing a user interface writing code it takes time it takes money and effort and if the users do not like the first version then we have to go back and write code and redesign the entire user interface from scratch so the solution for this is to develop prototypes so prototypes allow you to quickly test on users get some feedback and iterate so prototypes it helps us answer questions and also support designers in choosing between different alternatives so what are the purposes of prototyping it helps us test out the technical feasibility of an idea so some aspects of the user interface might not be very clear at the start and also we might have some very vague requirements so once we build a simple prototype and show it to users then they might give us feedback and it will help us clarify these vague requirements as well and prototyping is also useful for user testing and evaluating our initial prototypes or initial user interfaces so prototypes help us to build something quickly and get feedback quickly cut so now let us look at different types of prototypes so we can develop different types of prototypes based on the purpose and the time of development and also the fidelity fidelity refers to how real the interface is compared to the final product so in this graph you can see that storyboards and paper prototypes they are developed initially and they do not resemble the final product that much but as you move towards the right top right you see that digital mockups and interactive prototypes move closer to the final product which we want to build so now let us look at what storyboards are so storyboard is nothing but a hand-drawn comic that features three important elements one is the setting second the sequence of activities in the task and finally the satisfaction which the user receives so setting refers to the context in which the system the software or the app will be used for example who all other people involved what is the environment what is the task which needs to be accomplished and the second aspect is the sequence so what steps are involved and what is the task and how is it being illustrated all that comes in the sequence and finally the satisfaction so what motivates people to use the system what sense of accomplishment do they get after using the system and what need does the system fill so this also has to be mentioned in the storyboard so let's take an example of a storyboard so we will be looking at an application known as speakup so speakup is a virtual reality tool which can be used to give effective presentations so let's say we want to give a presentation in front of a large audience so before we give the actual presentation we can use speakup which is a vr application that simulates a presentation setting for us we can record our audio and hints are provided and all of these features are present in this tool so let's see how we can create a storyboard for such a tool so now let's look at the storyboard for the speak up vr application so recall that the first step in storyboarding is to develop the setting right so who are the people involved what is the environment and what is the task which has to be accomplished here you can see that a person he has to give a presentation on monday and he is practicing in front of a mirror but on the day of the presentation he is nervous and he he's not able to give the presentation well right so we see who are the people involved what is the environment and what is the task the task is to give an effective presentation now that the setting has been established now the second step is the sequence or what are the steps or what is the task which the software system helps the user to do so here you see that a friend recommends speak up to this person and talks about what all are the features in speak up and here we see that the user starts using speak up so he can choose a type of audience and he can start recording his audio we see that the system gives feedback gives comments the user can send the recording of his presentation to his mentor and there is a second round of practice so in all of these we see that the steps which are involved are clearly defined what is a task all that has been clearly defined in the storyboard and finally we see that this person presents effectively in front of the in front of an audience and this brings us to the third part of storyboarding which is the satisfaction right what motivates people to use the system or what is the sense of accomplishment that this person receives after using the system so here we can see that this person becomes confident he can effectively give a presentation in front of a large audience now that we have seen an example of a storyboard let's look at what are its benefits one is that a storyboard gives us a holistic focus right it emphasizes how the interface accomplishes a task without giving specific details about it also it avoids commitment to a particular user interface so in the case of the speak up storyboard you might have noticed that no user interface or none of the features were actually developed and finally it helps develop a shared understanding among the different stakeholders so this ensures that all the stakeholders are on the same page in terms of the goals of the software system which we want to build so we looked at storyboards another type of prototypes is to use paper prototypes so paper prototypes are simple it is a hand drawn user interface and we usually use multiple pieces of paper to actually draw the ui of different screens so let's look at an example so this is an example of an online library system for the deaf and hard of hearing or the dhh and speech impaired students so it has several features such as you know books are provided in indian sign language there are options for speech therapy etc so let's look at how we can develop a paper prototype for this application so this is a prototype for an online library for dhh and speech impaired students so as we mentioned in the paper prototype the different screens of the ui or all the elements of the ui are drawn on a piece of paper so here you can see that the first screen which a user encounters is the login screen and when the user clicks on a particular link or button what is the next screen which appears that is being shown so for example a user can be a student teacher or a parent so the appropriate user can click on the particular button and then it proceeds to show the options for different screens so if i click on a particular option what is the next screen which appears that is being shown this process continues for all the screens in the application so for example here when i choose isl which stands for indian sign language then there is a drop down in which i can choose the language which i want to see it in and for each option what are the different screens which are visible to me that is being shown so let's look at some benefits of these paper prototypes one is that it is much easier than writing code for the actual user interface right developing these paper prototypes involve just drawing something on a piece of paper drawing the different screens and hence it's much easier than writing code and with paper prototypes you can start conversations about user interactions as we saw that it gives us a flow of how the screens will progress for different features and this can be used to talk to the client and see if both the client and the developers are on the same page and third these elements can be changed immediately on the fly right if the client wants some features or some buttons or some navigation to be changed these elements can be changed immediately based on the given feedback so that was about paper prototypes another type of prototype is to use digital mockups using tools such as photoshop powerpoint etc and these are more closer to the final product so let's look at the same example of what we saw in the paper prototypes and let's see how we can transform or translate this paper prototype into a digital mockup so we saw how we can develop paper prototypes and now once we have these paper prototypes it is not very difficult to translate them into digital mockups so you can use tools like powerpoint photoshop and another tool which can help you do this is known as figma so let's see how this the paper prototype has been translated into a digital mockup so here you can see that you can explore the library so there are buttons which are clickable and i can click on any link right if i want to read some ebooks for a particular subject right and here i can see that these are the options which are available you need not enable all the options right so in this way a digital mockup can create or help you develop interactions for different screens in your application and it moves you closer to the final product and once you have this digital mock-up ready you can show it to clients get feedback from them and this will help you transition or move towards the final software product so in this video we looked at several prototyping techniques and we saw that these prototyping techniques they differ based on when it is used in the development process and its fidelity compared to the final product or how real the product is compared to the final product and we looked at several techniques and the important thing to note is that these prototypes they facilitate conversations about different things with their clients among developers designers etc so for example the storyboard it facilitates conversations about the user tasks or the use goals of the software system which we want to build paper prototypes goes one step further where we design the screens the ui elements on paper and this helps us facilitate conversations about the actual interactions in the system whereas in digital mockups and in interactive prototypes you talk about the visual design or you talk about the final details of the user interface so in this way these different type of prototyping techniques can help us refine our user interface and develop effective and usable interfaces
