in the previous led we looked at the importance of designing good user interfaces the user interface should realize the requirements provided by the user but it is also important that the interface is usable in this video we will be looking at what are certain goals and principles required to design usable interfaces so what does usability mean usability is an iso standard and it is defined as the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals and the following are the key usability goals such as effectiveness efficiency safe to use learnability and memorability we will look at each one in detail the first usability goal is effectiveness and this is a general goal which describes how good a system is at doing what it is supposed to do so is the system capable of let's say allowing people to learn well if it's a learning system or helps people carry out their work efficiently access the information they need buy the goods they want etc and such effective systems are there all around us so let's look at some examples a common example of an effective user interface is google and i'm sure all of you have used google multiple times each day google has a minimal design and the and if you notice the main functionality which is the search is at the center amazon also has a very effective ui so all the necessary information is on a single page such as the cost when i get it get the product offers all of this is on a single page and there is no need to scroll as well now let's look at efficiency so efficiency is the way a system supports users in carrying out the tasks it lets users carry out common tasks through a minimal number of steps and let's say users have learned how to use a system can they sustain a high level of productivity using the system efficient user interfaces helps users do that for example let's say we want to buy a product at amazon so how many clicks are required to buy an item at amazon so you click on buy now first then you select a delivery address then you select the payment method and then finally you can buy that and if you notice amazon avoids repetitive tasks such as it helps us save the delivery address save the card details so that users users who come again and again can buy an item quickly the next usability goal is safety so there are two aspects to safety the first aspect is protecting the user from dangerous conditions and undesirable situations for example the user interfaces of x-ray machines chemical plants they should be safe for example therap-25 was a radiation therapy machine it was the first of its kind which had a dual treatment mode and it used software based safety systems rather than hardware controls however one day while treating a patient the operator pressed x for the x-ray mode instead of e for the electron mode and this led to excess radiation and the death of a patient however most of us won't be using or designing such safety critical systems and the second aspect of safety is helping users in any situation to avoid carrying out actions accident so these unwanted actions can be we press wrong keys by mistake or if we have made some errors we should provide means of recovery to users so let's reflect on this question so most of you have used several software applications so recall certain software applications that you use and are there ways in which these applications have helped you reduce the risk of wrong keys being pressed or it provided a means of recovery if you made errors please pause this video and write down your responses before proceed so the second aspect of safety is helping users in any situation to avoid carrying out unwanted actions so think about software applications which have reduced the risk of wrong keys being pressed most common example is when you use document systems if you notice the save button and the close button are far apart right and if we look at if let's say this we have made certain errors there are several applications which provide a means of recovery as well examples of this are let's say you accidentally deleted a file on windows or any operating system you can easily recover it from the trash let's say you are editing a document in word and the computer accidentally shut down when you open word the next time you are provided with recovery options control z or undo is a common feature in most office software and even in whatsapp if you send a message by mistake you can always delete the message the next usability goal is learnability learnability refers to how easy a system is to learn to use people usually don't like spending a long time learning how to use a system they want to get started right away and carry out tasks without much effort so common applications like facebook instagram whatsapp so did you read a manual to use these systems no right you learned on the go as you started using these systems so these are fine for simple systems but what about complex systems where you have to perform complex tasks so let's reflect on this for a moment so what are ways in which you can help users learn how to use a complex system please pause the video and write down your responses before proceed so there are several ways in which you can make your system more learnable one way is to use wizards wizards are a step-by-step process of achieving a task it breaks down a complex task into simpler tasks another way is to use a tool so tools on the web page can be used where there are lots of information of features on a single web page and the tool highlights important areas or features of the page for new learners next is templates so templates provide defaults or structure based on the specific type of task so let's say you want to make a resume the resume template can help you do or create resumes fast so in these cases you don't have to start from scratch but can use a template and start using the system another important usability goal is memorability memorability refers to how system how easy a system is to remember how to use once learned this is especially important for interactive systems that are used infrequently so let's say if users haven't used a system for a few months or even longer they should be able to remember how to use it so they shouldn't have to keep relearning how to carry out tasks a good example of memorables a memorable system is microsoft word so there are meaningful icons command names menu options all of these help users remember where to look to find a particular tool to a given stage of a task so the usability goals which we described earlier are central while designing interactive systems but apart from this based on the type of software we are building we also want to make the user experience positive emotions while using the software so these can include making them making the user interface satisfying enjoyable fun helpful etc and these are known as user experience goals so they are more subjective and they are concerned with how users experience and interact with the product from their perspective rather than assessing how useful or productive a system is from its own perspective so these goals also have to be kept in mind while building interactive software products so this diagram provides a good summary of what we discussed in this led we looked at usability goals such as effectiveness efficiency safety learnability and memorability and then we also looked at user experience goals which are subjective positive experiences that the user should have while interacting with the software so the next time you use a system that you really enjoy try to think about which usability and user experience goals were satisfied by the user interface and i hope that these usability goals and user experience goals will be useful for you as you go about designing user interfaces for your projects
